<h3>Practicing across disciplines using graphic design as a medium, I've worked independently with a variety of companies, teams, and organizations. Recently, I joined <a href="https://mosaic.us" target="_blank">Mosaic</a> in San Francisco to shape the company's identity and product design. Previously I had co-founded <a href="https://alder.world" target="_blank">Alder</a>, a multidisciplenary design shop in a place I call home, Vermont.</h3>
