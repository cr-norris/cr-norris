<h3>Using graphic design to practice across disciplines, I've worked independently with a variety of companies, and organizations for over 9 years. Currently I am helping to shape communications and product within <a href="https://mosaic.us" target="_blank">Mosaic Builders</a> in San Francisco and Phoenix. Previously I founded <a href="https://alder.world" target="_blank">Alder</a>, a design shop in Burlington, Vermont.</h3>
