### On reclaiming our individual attention toward a collective refusal of the norms and taboos that block social, cultural and environmental progress. Reflecting on Selective Attention, and Collective Potential 10 years later.

In reading Jenny Odell's _How to Do Nothing_, fragments of projects over the last decade find themselves in context with historical movements, actions and stories. In the way that books can often be timely on a personal level, this text seems to appear at such a critical moment when many of these questions about how to spend time feel most pressing.

> "If we think about what it means to "concentrate" or "pay attention" at and individual level, it implies alignment: different parts of the mind and even the body acting in concert and oriented toward the same thing. To pay attention to one thing is to resist paying attention to other things; it means constantly denying and thwarting provocations outside the sphere of one's attention. We contrast this with distraction, in which the mind is disassembled, pointing in many directions at once and preventing meaningful action. It seems the same is true on a collective level. Just as it takes alignment for someone to concentrate and act with intention, it requires alignment for a "movement" to move. Importantly, this is not a top-down formation, but rather a mutual agreement among individuals who pay intense attention to the same things and to each other." *â€” How to Do Nothing, Jenny Odell*
